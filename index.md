My intention as a yoga teacher is to create an experience that creates a safe space where your nervous system can relax and mind and body connect. Here we exercise our ability to listen to our bodies mental and emotional state of being to better navigate our outer worlds. In my classes, you can expect to warm the body while holding postureâ€™s with subtle transitions to ground the inner chatter. I personally love the versatility of yoga as a resource for exploration, relaxation, empowerment and play; and warmly welcome each and every unique rhyme and reason that brings you to the mat.
