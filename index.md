4:30P TH @ [Vibrant Studio](http://www.vibrantstudiospdx.com/) & frequently subbing at [YogaBhoga](https://www.yogabhoga.com/?gclid=CNqxuO3OwdQCFQxqfgodmCgEnA) 







My intention as a yoga teacher is to create a peaceful enviorment where your nervous system can relax and the mind body connect. In class we exercise our ability to listen to our inner mental and emotional experience to better navigate our our  experience in daily life. In my classes, you can expect to warm the body while holding postureâ€™s with subtle transitions to ground the inner chatter. I personally love the versatility of yoga as a resource for exploration, relaxation, empowerment and play; and warmly welcome each and every unique rhyme and reason that brings you to the mat.
